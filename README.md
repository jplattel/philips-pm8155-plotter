# Philips PM8155 Plotter

I own a Philips PM8155 Plotter. There's almost no documentation available on the web, let alone any information on how to interface with it. This page serves as an archive and personal repository for scripts and tools that I made. 

In the future the repository will also contain scanned documentation that is available to me.

## Scripts

The `pm8155.py` file contains a basic serial interface to use the plotter.
